### Hi! I'm TOKI 👋

Here are a few things about me to get started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on computational engineering topics, art and entertainment, 
- MacOS operations research, open source writing, practice for profit business proposals, independent game 
- development, applied chaos theory, spiritual/religious research, Chinese/Japanese/Korean language and 
- cultural research, IRL streaming, online community writing, unicode emoji collection and utilization, 
- robot implementation, music production and distribution, and coding research (computational as well as street).
- 🥅 My goal is to live life to the fullest and continue on the path I've found myself following for the last 5 years.
- 🌱 I enjoy developing my ideas in virtual reality.
- 🌐 I also code HTML and CSS for my GitHub.io Potfolio Website.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on all sorts of things. If you have a pitch, pass it this way and I will at least give 
- you professional courtesy and try and give constructive criticism even if I'm not interested.
- 🤔 I always look for some company to co-work/study virtually.
- 🎙️ Fun Fact: I am a Discord Streamer! ("Secret Spy Succubi", Live Coding and Co-Working Stream, as well as 
- Live Art and Entertainment) 
- 📫 How to find me: Discord, Email, Instagram (Please see my website for more info.)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- 🤖 Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, node.js/discord.js

TOKI-BOT REPO WALKTHROUGH
This repo uses emoji for the branch names. It's basically because I don't understand Github yet and I like making stuff
up myself. If you want to request a fix to a problem with the code as it is in the release (1.1.1 as of now, 03/15/2023)
submit an "issue" to the (ﾉ≧∇≦)ﾉ ﾐ ┻━┻ branch (because you are making a ruckus in my painstakingly crafted Github repo attempts).
I will do my best to help solve problems with the existing release but I operate a Mac Ventura build with node.js/discord.js stables.
I will not be problem solving Windows or Linux builds so those writers must fend for themselves.

For those that don't know what they are doing on a MacOS with discord and node.js I will give a short explanation of how to make the
code do something of value. First, download the release. This will give you the binarybotblankey.js (toki-bot) and a package.json file.
The package.json file is the best I could do at listing all the dependencies (other packages you need to run on your MacOS build). Once
you have all the packages you need go to terminal, "cd workingdirectory" to get to the working directory you have the toki-bot in
and then excecute "node toki-bot.js" with discord open. You also need to have already gone to the discord developer's portal and
commissioned a bot to run on your server. You also need to have a text file in the working directory to collect each message to 
create your large data matrix file (if you are at all interested in that resource). Other than that, use the code that I gleaned 
to improve your other code, improve upon toki-bots code library, or just click some of the other links and read some of the other
text dumps I've prepared for wary google/bing researchers looking for free code-candy in a middle-aged man's cyber van in the interwebs.

Currently this trifecta business venture is owned, operated, and financed by one lonely coder that doesn't get paid squat diddly.
I can write a much more robust bot for myself but this minimal release is what the community gets for never financially supporting
independent writers. If I notice even a blip of support from this addition to the pursuit of scientific progress and interdependence
in 2023 during a global conflict, I will give other code grubbing graduates a resource of more value. Until then I will be focusing my
creative energy in an i, j, k formation from the center of my production of original thought. Honestly, time and resources would be 
better spent supporting those that are forced from their homes and widowed by war than on parlour tricks with a computer.
